## Introduction and Download

Visual Studio Code is a popular, cross platform source-code editor made by Microsoft. It is the recommended editor for EiE, although any other editor may work albeit without the debugger integration. VSCode can be downloaded from [Microsoft](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

## Extension Setup

EIE has a number of recommended extensions for VSCode. These can be found by searching `@recommended` in the extensions tab on the side bar. Install all the extensions under the Workspace Recommendations dropdown.

If you are unfamiliar with VScode extensions please see [Microsoft's Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace).

## Debugger

After installing the recommended extensions the VScode debugger should work to enable step through debugging on hardware. In the Run and Debug tab on the sidebar the debug profile can be set as either `Debug ASCII Board` or `Debug Dot Matrix Board` to debug your hardware.

If you are unfamiliar with the VScode debugger please see [Microsoft's Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).
